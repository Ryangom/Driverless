                Artificial Intelligence<br />
            </h1>
            <p>
                AI has become a popular buzz word these days, but how does it actually
                work in autonomous vehicles? Let us first look at the human
                perspective of driving a car with the use of sensory functions such as
                vision and sound to watch the road and the other cars on the road.
                When we stop at a red light or wait for a pedestrian to cross the
                road, we are using our memory to make these quick decisions.
                <br /><br />The years of driving experience habituate us to lookfor
                the little things that we encounter often on the roads — it could bea
                better route to the office or just a big bump in the road. We are
                building autonomous vehicles that drive themselves, but we want them
                to drive like human drivers do. That means we need to provide these
                vehicles with the sensory functions, cognitive functions (memory,
                logical thinking, decision-making and learning) and executive
                capabilities that humans use to drive vehicles. The automotive
                industry is continuously evolving to achieve exactly this over the
                last few years. <br /><br />According to Gartner, by 2020, 250 million
                cars&nbsp;will be connected with each other and the infrastructure
                around them through various V2X (vehicle-to-everything communication)
                systems. As the amount of information being fed into IVI (in-vehicle
                infotainment) units or telematics systems grows, vehicles will be able
                to capture and share not only internal system status and location data
                but also the changes in its surroundings, all in real time. Autonomous
                vehicles are being fitted with cameras, sensors and communication
                systems to enable the vehicle to generate massive amounts of data
                which, when applied with AI, enables the vehicle to see, hear, think
                and make decisions just like human drivers do.<br /><br />

                        <br />Think of the ID. Light as the way your <br />ID.4
                        communicates with you. An intuitive light bar that runs across the
                        <br />dashboard, the ID. Light uses glowing visual and acoustic
                        cues to <br />telegraph incoming calls, brake warnings, charge
                        status and more.<br/><br/>

                        <br />The ID.4 senses your presence and <br />intuitively starts
                        when you have your key fob and you sit in the driver’s seat,
                        “waking up” automatically. Screens blink on, and the car <br />is
                        ready for the road.<br/><br/>
